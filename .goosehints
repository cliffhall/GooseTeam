# GooseTeam
We are working on a way for multiple goose sessions to collaborate using Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Status
* Working, unit-tested MCP server in src/ folder, built with Typescript
* Currently expanding the MCP toolset available to GooseTeam agents for collaboration.
* Task tools have been added, but the protocol does not yet direct agents in their use.

# MCP Specification
The full Model Context Protocol specification is in /Users/cliffhall/Projects/mcp-specification
with the typescript spec defined here: /Users/cliffhall/Projects/mcp-specification/schema/2024-11-05/schema.ts
