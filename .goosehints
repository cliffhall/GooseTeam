# GooseTeam
We are working on a way for multiple goose sessions to collaborate using Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Status
* Currently testing Goose Agent collaboration with a small software library porting project.

## The Project
### Goal
* We are porting the PureMVC State Machine Utility for ActionScript 3 to TypeScript
    - TypeScript and ActionScript are very similar, and so the port should be straightforward.
    - We will be using the TypeScript port of PureMVC (npm i @puremvc/puremvc-typescript-multicore-framework)
    - We are only interested in porting the multi-core version.
    - ONE DIFFERENCE:
        - There is a tool in the AS3 version called FSMInjector, which allows easy definition of state machines in XML.
        - We want that to use JSON for the TypeScript version, with zod schema validation.

### Folders
* For local reference, in the folder ~/Projects/ you will find
    - puremvc-as3-util-statemachine (the code we are porting - read only)
    - puremvc-typescript-util-statemachine (the folder for the ported version - write here)
    - puremvc-typescript-multicore-framework (the PureMVC MultiCore Framework for TypeScript - read only)
